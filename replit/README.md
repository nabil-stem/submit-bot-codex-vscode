# Replit Landing Setup

This folder is a lightweight landing page to drive traffic to your main repo and releases.

## Why this exists

The desktop bot is Windows-only and uses UI Automation APIs, so it is not a direct runtime fit for Replit.
Use Replit as a public demo/landing page, not as the main runtime target.

## Run on Replit

1. Import this repo into Replit.
2. Set run command to `python server.py` (already in `.replit`).
3. Publish the Replit app URL in your social launch posts.

## Update Links

Edit `index.html` if you want to add:

- Chrome Web Store URL
- Edge Add-ons URL
- Product Hunt / docs links
