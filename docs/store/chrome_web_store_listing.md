## Extension Name

Submit Auto-Clicker (Safe)

## Short Description

Allowlist-based submit auto-clicker with dry-run safeguards for selected websites.

## Detailed Description

Submit Auto-Clicker helps you automate repetitive submit actions with strict safety controls.

### What it does

- Watches allowed pages for allowed button labels.
- Uses visibility + enabled-state checks before any action.
- Supports dry-run mode (log only, no click).
- Shows on-page "Auto-click active" status and last action timestamp.
- Includes per-site toggle and global toggle in popup.

### Safety by default

- No URL is automated unless it is explicitly allowlisted.
- Global automation starts OFF.
- Dry-run mode starts ON.
- Cooldown prevents repeated rapid clicks.

### Ideal use cases

- Internal tools with repetitive confirmations.
- Controlled QA/staging environments.
- Form-heavy workflows where safe automation is needed.

### Limitations

- Dynamic UI changes may require selector tuning.
- You remain responsible for configured allowlists and outcomes.
