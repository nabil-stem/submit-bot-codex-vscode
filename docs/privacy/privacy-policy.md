# Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 23, 2026

This policy applies to the Submit Auto-Clicker project (desktop app and browser extension).

## Data Collection

The project does not send data to external servers by default.

The browser extension stores configuration locally in browser storage:

- URL allowlist patterns
- button text patterns
- toggles (global/per-site/dry-run)
- local last-action timestamps

The desktop app stores local configuration and logs on your machine.

## Data Sharing

No built-in third-party analytics, ad trackers, or remote APIs are used.

## User Control

- You can disable automation at any time.
- You can clear local extension storage from browser extension settings.
- You can delete desktop logs/config from your local app data folder.

## Security Responsibility

Automation can trigger real actions. Users are responsible for safe configuration, especially allowlists and live-click mode.

## Contact

Replace this section with your support email or website contact form before publishing.
